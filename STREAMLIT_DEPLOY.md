## 💡 ALTERNATIVE: GitHub Pages (Static Only)

**Note:** GitHub Pages can only host static HTML sites, NOT Python applications. Streamlit requires a server to run Python code, so GitHub Pages won't work for this dashboard. You MUST use Streamlit Cloud (or similar) to host this app.

If you wanted a static webpage (no Python, just HTML/CSS/JS), GitHub Pages would work, but you'd lose all the interactive Python features.

**Stick with Streamlit Cloud - it's designed for this!** 🎯
