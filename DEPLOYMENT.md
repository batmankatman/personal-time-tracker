# 🚀 Quick Deployment Guide

## Current Status: ✅ Dashboard is Running Locally

Your dashboard is currently accessible at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:8501
- **Network**: http://192.168.1.97:8501 (same WiFi only)

## ⚠️ Important: Keeping the Dashboard Running

### The dashboard WILL STOP if:
- ❌ You close the terminal
- ❌ Your computer sleeps or shuts down  
- ❌ You run `pkill -f streamlit`

### To keep it running in the background:
```bash
cd "/Users/kamonwhiteside/Downloads/pythonics/Prod Program ai3"
nohup .venv/bin/streamlit run activity_dashboard.py --server.headless true > streamlit.log 2>&1 &
```

### To stop it:
```bash
pkill -f streamlit
```

### To check if it's running:
```bash
ps aux | grep streamlit | grep -v grep
```
