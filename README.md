- Activity intensity by hour

## Installation

1. **Set up Python environment**:
   ```bash
   cd "path/to/your/project"
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit plotly pandas numpy
   ```

## Usage

### Web Dashboard
1. **Start the dashboard**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run activity_dashboard.py
   ```

2. **Access the dashboard**:
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`
   - Upload your `diaw.txt` file or place it in the same directory
   - Use the sidebar filters to customize your analysis

### Data Format
Your `diaw.txt` file should follow this format:

```
7/24/25 Th 0830-0040
0030 LO lo
0025 S comm
0020 R br
0015 P notes
0000 F yt
2345 P school
...
```

**Format specifications**:
- **Day headers**: `M/D/YY DayOfWeek StartTime-EndTime`
- **Activity records**: `HHMM Category Description`
- **Categories**: P, R, E, S, W, F, GOD, LO (see legend above)

## Dashboard Sections

### üìä Overview Tab
- Activity category distribution pie chart
- Activity count by category bar chart
- Category summary statistics table

### ‚è∞ Time Analysis Tab
- Daily time allocation by category
- Stacked daily time view
- Interactive time allocation charts

### üìà Trends Tab
- Weekly activity patterns
- Time of day heatmap
- Activity intensity analysis

### üéì Courses Tab
- Course-specific time tracking
- ITSC vs homework comparison
- STAT vs homework comparison
- Pattern matching analysis

### üò¥ Sleep Tab
- Sleep duration distribution histogram
- Sleep statistics and metrics
- Sleep trend analysis over time

## Based On
This dashboard is based on the comprehensive analysis methodology from `activity_analysis.ipynb`, including:
- Data parsing and duration calculation algorithms
- Fall-themed visualization color schemes
- Activity categorization system
- Sleep analysis methodology

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: Streamlit for web interface
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts
- **Data Processing**: Pandas and NumPy
- **Caching**: Streamlit's @st.cache_data for performance
- **Color Scheme**: Fall-themed palette with dark compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed in your virtual environment
2. **File not found**: Place `diaw.txt` in the same directory as the script
3. **Date parsing errors**: Verify your date format matches M/D/YY
4. **Empty visualizations**: Check that your activity categories match the expected codes

### Performance Tips
- Use date range filters for large datasets
- The dashboard caches parsed data for faster reloading
- Consider filtering categories for focused analysis

## Example Analysis Outputs
- Daily time allocation showing 8+ hours of productive activities
- Weekly patterns revealing productivity peaks
- Sleep analysis showing average 7-8 hours per night
- Course tracking showing homework vs lecture time ratios

## Future Enhancements
- Export functionality for charts and data
- Comparison between different time periods
- Goal setting and progress tracking
- Mobile-responsive design improvements

## üöÄ Sharing & Deployment Guide

### Will the dashboard stay running?
**NO** - The Streamlit dashboard will stop when:
- ‚ùå You close the terminal window
- ‚ùå Your computer goes to sleep or shuts down
- ‚ùå You run `pkill -f streamlit`

**To keep it running locally:**
```bash
# Run in background (keeps running even if terminal closes)
nohup streamlit run activity_dashboard.py --server.headless true &

# Stop it later with:
pkill -f streamlit
```
