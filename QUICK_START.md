## ❓ Your Questions Answered

### 1. Will the Streamlit site keep running?

**Short answer: NO, not automatically.**

The dashboard will **STOP** running if:
- ❌ You close the terminal window
- ❌ Your computer goes to sleep
- ❌ Your computer shuts down
- ❌ You manually kill the process

**To keep it running while computer is on:**
```bash
# Run in background (won't stop if you close terminal)
cd "/Users/kamonwhiteside/Downloads/pythonics/Prod Program ai3"
nohup .venv/bin/streamlit run activity_dashboard.py --server.headless true > streamlit.log 2>&1 &

# Check if running
ps aux | grep streamlit

# Stop it
pkill -f streamlit
```
